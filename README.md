# Our Approach
1. first we tried that can we get apis for live data for movies but we didnt got any
2. Then we tried omdb dataset but it doesnt give any live info
3. we tried scraping the ticket booking webpages but that was too lengthy
4. Then we finally got technique that give live data of movies in from every corner of india , the code for is written in helper_funtions.py
5. then we tried using llama3.2 but it was not great model the accuracy was not good and the time taken to complete the request was too much
6. then we somehow arranged chatgpt 4 api but that too was challenging and it got rate limit and we were unable to get good outcomes from it
7. Then last we again fall back to the local model , and its slow , but we the great thing is that we can get **real time data of movies** and we can retrive data of every city in India

Deployment Guide
To deploy Lunar-Bot and get it running, follow these steps:
  1. Setup the Environment
    Create a virtual environment in your local system:
            python -m venv lunarbot-env
   Activate the virtual environment:
    On Windows:
            lunarbot-env\Scripts\activate
    On macOS/Linux:
            source lunarbot-env/bin/activate
  2. Install Requirements
    Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies:
            pip install -r requirements.txt
  3. Run the Application
    Execute the main script to start Lunar-Bot:
            python run.py
  4. Initial Embedding Setup
    The first execution may take additional time to embed the Llama model and index data. Please be patient as this is a one-time setup.

#While Lunar-Bot is highly reliable, deployment has highlighted a few minor issues:
Embedding Delays: As mentioned earlier, the first-time loading of models may take time but can be optimized in future iterations.
UI Improvements: Enhancing the frontend for a more intuitive user experience.
Additional Features: Adding filters for specific genres, price ranges, or languages.
These issues are easily fixable and will be addressed in subsequent updates.
